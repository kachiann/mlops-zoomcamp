# EXPERIMENT TRACKING
---

## Key Definitions

* **ML Experiment**: The procedure of constructing an ML model.
* **Experiment Run**: Every iteration within an ML experiment.
* **Run Artifact**: Any file linked to an ML run.
* **Experiment Metadata**: Information describing an ML experiment's characteristics and parameters.


These three primary reasons are crucial for experiment tracking:

* Reproducibility: Ensuring that experiments can be replicated reliably.
* Organization: Structuring and managing experiments systematically for clarity and efficiency.
* Optimization: Enhancing experimentation processes to achieve better results efficiently.
