# End-to-End ML Project

Welcome to my end-to-end machine learning (ML) project. This project is a comprehensive guide to building a full-fledged ML pipeline from dataset selection to deployment and monitoring.

## Project Steps

1. **Dataset Selection**
   - I have selected a dataset that interests me from the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset) Machine Learning Repository.

2. **Trained a Model**
   - I trained a model using the selected dataset and meticulously track my experiments. This process includes:
     - Data preprocessing and cleaning
     - Feature engineering and selection
     - Model training and validation
     - Hyperparameter tuning
     - Experiment logging and tracking

3. **Created a Model Training Pipeline**
   - Developing a robust and scalable model training pipeline is key. This involves:
     - Data ingestion and preprocessing
     - Model training and validation
     - Model versioning and packaging

4. **Deployed the Model**
   - Deployed the trained model.

5. **Monitored Model Performance**
   - Setting up monitoring to ensure the model performs optimally post-deployment is crucial. This includes:
     - Tracking key performance metrics
     - Detecting data and concept drift
     - Implementing alerting and logging mechanisms

6. **Following Best Practices**
   - Adhering to industry best practices throughout the project ensures quality and reliability. This includes:
     - Writing clean and maintainable code
     - Documenting the process and code
     - Using version control effectively
     - Implementing CI/CD pipelines
     - Ensuring security and compliance
