# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
## Project Description:
The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict bike-sharing demand using historical data. This prediction will help optimize bike distribution and availability in a bike-sharing system.

## Problem Statement:
Bike-sharing systems are becoming increasingly popular in urban areas as a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. However, managing the distribution of bikes to meet demand is challenging. The objective of this project is to predict the number of bikes required at different stations at different times of the day to ensure optimal availability and customer satisfaction.
By addressing these challenges through data analysis, the project aims to enhance the overall user experience, increase operational efficiency, and promote sustainable urban transportation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Bike Sharing Demand" dataset, which includes historical data on bike rentals, weather conditions, and timestamps. This dataset is available on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset) Machine Learning Repository.
