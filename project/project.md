## Project Description:
The project involves analyzing bike sharing data to understand usage patterns, optimize bike availability, and improve service efficiency. Bike sharing systems typically consist of a network of stations where users can rent bikes for short periods, making them popular in urban areas for commuting and leisure.

## Problem Statement:
The primary challenge addressed by this project is to maximize the utilization of bikes and stations while minimizing operational costs. Specific problems include:

1. **Demand Prediction**: Predicting the demand for bikes at different times and locations to ensure adequate supply and avoid shortages.

2. **User Behavior Analysis**: Understanding user preferences, such as trip durations, to improve service customization and marketing strategies.

By addressing these challenges through data analysis, the project aims to enhance the overall user experience, increase operational efficiency, and promote sustainable urban transportation.
